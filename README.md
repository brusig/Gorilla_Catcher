# Gorilla_Catcher
### Image Identification model and GUI

This project is split into two different notebooks, one which creates the image identification model and one which is a GUI in which you can upload your own images and see if it's a gorilla or a human!

91% accuracy overall, with a 50/50 split between humans and gorillas.

Unfortunately I will not provide the images I have trained the model on, due to the sheer size (30k+ images).
